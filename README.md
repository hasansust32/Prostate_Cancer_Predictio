# Prostate Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict and analyze prostate cancer. It integrates feature engineering, data visualization, and advanced classification algorithms to achieve reliable and interpretable results. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis.

## Features

- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Understand trends and patterns in prostate cancer datasets using tools like `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
- **Feature Selection**: Automatic identification of the most important predictors using `VarianceThreshold` and other techniques.
- **Deep Learning**: Implementation of neural networks with `keras` for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed performance analysis using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

## Requirements

This project requires Python and the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prostate-cancer-prediction.git
   cd prostate-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [Prostate Cancer Dataset](https://example.com/prostate-dataset) (replace with the actual link).
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Launch the Jupyter Notebook to explore and execute the code:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook prostate_cancer_using_Machine_learning.ipynb
   ```
